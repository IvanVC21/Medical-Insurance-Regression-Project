# Medical-Insurance-Regression-Project

## General Info
I made this project on my free time in order to put in practice and showcase my data and machine learning skills. The project main goal is to create a model that can predict well the cost of a medical insurance based on some features such as age, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits and many more. As an achievement, I could say that I maanged to get 10 models with a score of 0.90 R2!. Dataset was obtained from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)
